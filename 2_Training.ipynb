    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic architecture is like this: A pretrained ResNet serves as CNN encoder to extract spatial features from input image. The extracted feature will be the first input to two-layered LSTM, the decoder, to generate the first output word (which is the start word). The rest of sentence will be fed into the decoder in sequence until the max len is reached or the end word is generated. In the training phase, each batch consists of images and captions of the same length. These captions will be fed into the decoder in order along with the embeded spatial features as the first input. This will help train the model in parallel. And a dropout layer is included in the first layer of LSTM which introduces a certain amount of randomness and helps reduce overfitting. In the testing phase, a sampling method will be used in this application, where the output word is fed back into the decoder until the max lengh of sentence is reached or the end word is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In term of hyperparameters' selection, 256 is chosen as the embed size and 512 is selected as the hidden size according to the guidlines by Andrej Karpathy [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) where the total number of parameters should be larger than and about the same order of the size of training samples. There are total 414K captions with each with about 10 words on avarge. Plus we also should add the complexity of image features into considerations. A two layered LSTM with 256 as embed size and 512 as hidden size has 11M parameters in total. This should be enough for this application. Note that the parameters of the encoder is not to be trained except its final fc/embed layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose 10 as the batch size as it is enough to provide a good sample distribution and helps to speed up the weight updating. No vocabulary threshold is set as I think this keeps the integrity of vocab library and the model will be able to handle some rare cases based on word embedding and context in sentences. 3 is chose as the number of epochs as it is enough to produce a good results and the loss decaying is very much slowing down at epoch 3 already.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) before implementing anything in this project and consult it during the process as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I left the transform as it is because it is good enough to transform the sample images into the format that fits the requirement of ResNet(224x224, normalized in each color channel). More than that, it randomly crops from the resized image, which is slightly larger than 224x224 and perform random horizontal flipping. This is essentially some sort of data augmentation that helps to train a robust model and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters in decoder and the fc/embed layer of encoder are set to be trainable. This is a good choice since all the parameters in decoder (word embedding, LSTM, linear layer) have to be trained in order to understand how to caption an image based on the spatial features. The fc/embed layer in encoder is also trainable since it transform the spatial features into forms that decoder understands. The parameters in CNN/ResNet layers are not to be trained as they are all ready good enough in terms of extracting spatial features from raw images. Setting them trainable will most likely produce poorer results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I choose Adam as the optimizer instead of SGD as it adaptively adjust the learning rate and is able to produce a model that is about as good as what SGD could deliver. This is important for a starter model as we don't know exacly the range of learing rate for a SGD that could balance the training time and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I consult the blog of Andrej Karpathy [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) for optimizer selection in this application."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
